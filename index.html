                    <h2> RIGZEN NAMGAIL</h2>
                    <p>This is Rigzen Namgail from eastern Ladakh near to the border of China. And I do study at JNTUA of Andhra Pardesh, currently I am doing B.tech in Computer Science as 3rd year in this college. Well I must include my schooling here, I did my both matriculation and post matric from Govt Hr. Sec. School Nyoma (GHSS NYOMA). My  dream is to open a  school in which a student from 6 year old could come and 60 year old man/women can  also come and study.
                        I gave my first intrance as NDA but I was rejected there after that I choose B.tech and now I am preparing for CDS. As these is my project for social welfare I am trying to help my junior about there carrer and want to show them right way.
                        May be I am not that much experienced but what i got in these 2 year after school must be shared with them I believe.  Also may be some of you guys might inspired. I have a little request to you people who are liking the way I am doing my work and sharing the views to all taht plz give a feedback in the table below even you dont want to know about computer Languages but for sure give a responce in your own Language too.

                        THANK YOU!!
